# Plain Text to SQL Query Converter

## Project Overview

Plain Text to SQL Query Converter is a web-based application designed to transform natural language input into structured SQL queries and retrieve data from a MySQL database. The project uses a React-based frontend and integrates the Grok API to interpret user input intelligently and generate accurate SQL queries. It supports multiple languages, enabling users to interact with databases without requiring prior knowledge of SQL. The system simplifies database querying, improves accessibility for non-technical users, and increases productivity for developers and data analysts.

## Technology Stack

Frontend: React.js
Backend Logic: API-based query processing
Database: MySQL
AI Integration: Grok API
Package Manager: npm
Version Control: Git and GitHub

## Frontend Setup and Execution

The frontend is developed using React. To run the frontend, ensure Node.js and npm are installed on the system. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code, open a terminal, and navigate to the project directory. Install the required dependencies using npm install. Once the installation is complete, start the frontend application using npm start. The application will run locally on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and provide a user interface for entering plain text queries and viewing results.

## Backend and Database Configuration

The backend logic relies on API-based communication for query generation and execution. A MySQL database must be installed and running on the local system or a remote server. Create a database and required tables before running the application. Database connection details such as host, username, password, and database name must be configured using environment variables. These credentials are used to execute the SQL queries generated by the system.

## Grok API Integration

The Grok API is used to convert plain text input into valid SQL queries. User input from the frontend is sent to the Grok API, which analyzes the natural language prompt and generates the corresponding SQL query. The generated query is then validated and executed on the MySQL database. An API key from Grok is required and should be stored securely in an environment configuration file. The API supports multi-language input, enabling the application to process queries written in different natural languages.

## Environment Variables

The project requires environment variables for secure configuration. These include the Grok API key and database connection credentials. A .env file should be created in the project root directory to store these values. Sensitive information such as API keys and database passwords should not be exposed publicly.

## Application Workflow

The user enters a plain text query through the frontend interface. The input is sent to the Grok API, which converts it into an SQL query. The generated SQL query is executed on the MySQL database. The retrieved results are returned to the frontend and displayed to the user in a readable format. This workflow allows seamless interaction with the database using natural language.

## Project Use Cases

This project is suitable for educational purposes, database learning, internal tools, and applications where users need to interact with databases without writing SQL manually. It can be extended for enterprise use cases by adding authentication, query validation, and support for additional databases.
